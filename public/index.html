					<h2>What is the EWB Design Challenge?</h2>
					<p>The challenge aims for a prototpye of an application to be created which will address one or more of the challenge areas faced
					by the Lobitos and Piedritas communities situated on the northern coast of Peru. These challenge areas include the built environment,
					food, energy, waste, water, sanitation, transport and digital. The two communities lack or have major issues with each of these areas.
					Our group's application focuses on addressing water and sanitation as they are both closely related.</p>

					<h2>About the Lobitos and Piedritas</h2>
					<p>Lobitos and Piedritas are two neighbouring communities on the northern coast of Peru. Lobitos is a small fishing and surfing town of
					1,300 residents while Piedritas is a small and offically not regognised community of only 400 residents. Due to it not being offical established,
					Piedritas has trouble accessing basic services such as electricity and water. Although tourism, mainly surf tourism, has been increasing in both
					communities, most of the profit goes to foreign owned businesses meaning that local inhabitants can't fully benefit from it. The general lack of
					economic activity has meant that the poverty rate for Lobitos is 30% and 80% for Piedritas.
